## Information Returned

### Fast Boot
Most IT pros think this should be 0 (Off). Windows is 1 (On) by default.<br>
If Fast Boot is on for a computer, it means that shut down is the same as hibernation. In this case a shut down is not as good as a restart for applying updates etc. 
Turn this off to go back to a slower but safer shutdown.  The speed benefit is negligible anyway if an SSD is installed.
<br>
#### To turn off fast startup (hiberbootenabled) manually <br>
Note: This is a system setting and will require admin access to change. <br>

> Press Win+R > Type "control" > Type "power buttons" > Turn on fast
> startup [Untick this box]
